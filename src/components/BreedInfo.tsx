                <h3>Coined the Gentle Giant</h3>
                <p>Great Pyrenees are a very large breed of dog, with the average height between 27 to 32 inches for a male and 25 to 29 inches for a female. On average, Great Pyrenees should be between 100 to 160 pounds for a male and 85 to 115 pounds for a female.  </p>
                <p>It is important to know adulthood doesn’t start until about 3 years of age in this breed until this point they are very much a puppy. </p>

                <h3>There is hair on Great Pyrs and hair on Great Pyr People!</h3>
                <p>Pyrs generally have a double coat this long hair provides them warmth in weather that we would find unbearable. This thick hair gives them a layer of near waterproofing which can make bathing time long and tedious but well worth it. That brilliant white coat is so very eye catching. This thick coat not only insulates them in the winter from the cold but provide an insulation in times of extreme heat actually helping them to maintain their temperatures, it is never advised to shave a pyr unless for medical purposes. </p>

                <h3>Undesirable Traits </h3>
                <p>First and foremost it is important to note that no dog or human is perfect for that matter andt not all dogs will have all these traits or even one of these traits but as they are very synonymous with the pyr breed and are something to take into consideration. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The shedding. Get your vacuum serviced because you will be spending some quality time together.</li>
                  <li>Barking. Asking a pyr not to bark is like me asking you not to breathe and it’s not just any bark but it’s called a booming bark and yes it has the ability to scare off bears. If your pyr is barking its for your protection and the protection of your things.</li>
                  <li>Digging. Pyrs are very powerful and often turn over cool patches of dirt especially in the summer to sleep on.</li>
                  <li>Independent. Pyrs were bred to sit in a field all day and think independently about what needed to be done and then carry it out. They can be very focused on what they perceive is their job. This can make pyrs hard to train, not because they are not smart, more because they have to find worth in the thing you are asking them to do. They don’t care much for pointless parlor tricks</li>
                  <li>They are known to wander. They have immense stamina and often given opportunity will set up about a 5 mile radius of space to patrol unless taught otherwise </li>
                  <li>They can hear a threat through a closed house with the TV on and ac blowing every threat may = a bark </li>
                  <li>Susceptible to large breed health problems</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Falling In Love</h3>
                <p>Pyrs just have that Pyr-zazz that will make you fall in love. Once again not every dog will have all or even one of these traits. </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Despite being fiercely independent they are fiercely loyal dogs and have been known to protect their families with their lives </li>
                  <li>They have a natural tendency towards small, helpless, and even wounded creatures. Most pyrs can’t help but fall in love with kids</li>
                  <li>Polar Bear effect. Even though it can drive you crazy there is something to be said about pyr fluff</li>
                  <li>Naturally Nocturnal. Lazy during the day and more active during the times families get home from school and work, patrolling long into the night</li>
                  <li>If your love to walk they have the stamina to walk long distances </li>
                  <li>Usually very laid back and easy going </li>
                  <li>Pyr Hugs. Yes it is not uncommon given the option your dog will get on hinds to hug you like a human google great pyrnees, I bet you find pictures of them on their hinds</li>
                  <li>The head snuggle. They like to bow their head and snuggle it into you.  </li>
                  <li>Pyrs have double dew claws on the hinds it’s a mark of the great pyr and are not removed it sets them apart and helps them climb mountains!</li>
                  <li>Pyrs can be very expressive not only in the barks which you will learn mean something different based on the sound to their facial expressions, they can be very expressive. With thick eyelashes and dark eyeliner. </li>
                  <li>Instant Celebrity. Pyrs are noticed everywhere they go. Their size and bright white thick coats are very aesthetically pleasing to most people and people can’t help but be drawn in stopping you and asking to touch your dog. </li>
                </ul>
